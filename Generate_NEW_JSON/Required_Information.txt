* Before you generate the DST-corrected, joined .json file of polygon vertices make sure you have 
downloaded all necessary spectral & trajectory data from directories labeled 
"cassini_saturn_skr/SKR_spectrogram_data" and "cassini_saturn_skr/trajectory"
    * You will find these large files on the DIAS Ariadne Server
